SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<p>

PREAMBLE<br>
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.<p>

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.<p>

DEFINITIONS<br>
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.<p>

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).<p>

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).<p>

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the

writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.<p>

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS<br>

binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.<p>

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.<p>

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
